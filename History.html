                <small>2001</small>
                <p> In the bustling tech hub of Jakarta City, in the early 2000s, a group of parents who were also savvy entrepreneurs found themselves facing a common challenge â€“ finding reliable and trustworthy babysitters for their children. Fueled by the desire to create a solution for their community, they embarked on a mission to launch a platform that would redefine childcare.  </p>
