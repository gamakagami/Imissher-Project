            <div class="nannydescription">We provide nanny services to provide support towards parents who have difficulties in supervising their children, usually due to work. Nannies are similar to what babysitters do, the difference is that nannies are more experienced. Another difference is that there are two different types of nannies such as live-in nannies and live-out nannies. Live-in nannies stay in the customer's household, while live-out nannies do not. Thus, live-in nannies are more flexible and have longer working hours. As a result, the price of live-in nannies are significantly higher than live-out nannies. <br><div class="price2">Average Price: Live-out Nannies: ($10-$15)/hour <br> <div class="in">Live-in Nannies: ($15 - $25)/hour (Working hours only)</div></div></div>
